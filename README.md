### Bet a dice

Bet a dice" is a game for a quick bet.
If you like numbers, dicegame and bets, this is a simple game to play.
You choose 3 numbers from the number board to bet.
After that, roll the dice and see what the dice gets for number.
If any of your choice is the same as the dot, you win! Otherwise you lose.
The game is build with colours and animation to get it lively and fun.
The idea is taken from the betwheel at the fairground.

## Structure

I started to draw a skeleton in Balsamiq.
My first thought was to build a 2048 - game  to with a board with number to merge into higher values and scores, but after a while I realised it was not in this scoop and a little to comlicated for PP2, so I restarted with this game and used the same idea for skeleton

## Design
I schoosed i colourful font to get a happy feeling and border-radius so the buttons are not so "stiff"

WHen I tested the game on smaller screens as mobile and ipad, I saw the font won´t show the coloursand it was dark approach, so I changed the background colour and used the font Bungee instead of.

## Future Features to Implement

# 2 degrees of difficulty you can choose between.
Easy is the same with 3 numbers or even 4 numbers and a harder degree is to choose only 2 numbers.

# Counter how many rolls you need to reach 24 points.
A counter to add the dice number for every times you win and count how many rolls you need to reach 24.

# Best score
Right hand side will represent a best score list with rolls for 24. When you reach 24, you have a choice to write your name to the score and it will put you on the best score list.
